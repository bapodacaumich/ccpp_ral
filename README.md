# Semi-Autonomous Visual Inspection Trajectory Planning for the ISS

This repository contains the code and simulation assets for the paper:

**"Semi-Autonomous In-Orbit Inspection of Complex Space Structures via Coverage-Aware Trajectory Optimization"**

## üìÑ Summary

Extravehicular activity (EVA) for ISS visual inspection poses safety risks to astronauts. This project presents a trajectory generation pipeline for space robots that enables safe, semi-autonomous inspection of complex space structures. Our method integrates:

- **Orbital dynamics modeling**
- **Coverage path planning**
- **Energy and thrust constraints**
- **Pareto front analysis** for balancing fuel and inspection coverage
- **Human supervisor situation awareness** modeling

The resulting trajectories achieve **98% coverage** using just **17 grams of fuel** on an ISS-scale model, demonstrating effective and efficient planning for in-orbit visual inspection.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Features

- Collision-aware trajectory generation
- Optimization of coverage vs. fuel usage
- Orbital mechanics constraints (Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics)
- Visualization of trajectories and coverage
- Simulation of free-flyer robot behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bapodacaumich/ccpp_public.git
cd ccpp_public
```

# C++ file creation

create a build folder and use cmake to create executables for ordered coverage viewpoint optimization

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Python Packages

Requirements: python==3.10.9

Python packages: requirements.txt

## üöÄ Usage

Generate ordered viewpoints, then generate an optimized trajectory guided by the ordered viewpoints. Finally, visualize solutions.

# Ordered Viewpoint Generation

Run the main script to generate ordered viewpoint solutions for a specified VGD and locality constraint.

```bash
./run_ccpp [vgd] [-l]
```

ordered viewpoint solutions are stored in /data/ordered_viewpoints/ as [vgd]m_[local OR global].csv files 
- 'global' indicates no local condition was applied
- the resulting file is a list of ordered viewpoints and poses for obstacle avoidance that correspond to ${\hat{q}_i}$ in the paper.

# Trajectory Optimization and Pareto Front Tuning

The '/knot_ocp/' folder contains python code for trajectory optimization and pareto front selection.

1. pareto_grid.py: contains functions that can be used to create solutions with a prespecified range of weights. Each solution is a set of ordered states including position, velocity, control actuation, and timestep information. Each solution is saved in three files:
- *_X.csv: position and velocity of optimized trajectory at each discretized state
- *_U.csv: control actuation for each timestep
- *_t.csv: timestamps of each discretized state

2. package_path.py: processes solutions outputs from the optimal control formulation

3. /build/get_coverage/: evaluates the coverage of each processed solution for Pareto tuning

4. pareto_front.py: contains functions that can be used to evaluate the pareto front solutions within a set of a solutions. You must pick a solution(s) from the pareto front that optimizes coverage and fuel consumption to your liking.

# Trajectory Visualization

The '/visualization_python/' folder contains python code for solution visualization.

Inspection quality evaluation can be performed by first evaluating a finely discretized trajectory using 

## üìä Results

Example output includes:

- Inspection coverage heatmaps
- Trajectory plots in orbital frame
- Fuel consumption statistics
- Pareto fronts of coverage vs. energy usage
